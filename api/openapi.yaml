          The way to sort the results.

          Option descriptions:
           * `alphabetical` - Sort the results alphabetically by title.
           * `date` - Sort the results by date.
           * `default` - Use the default sorting method.
           * `duration` - Sort the results by duration.
           * `last_user_action_event_date` - Sort the results by last user interaction. If a result hasn't had an interaction, the upload date is used instead.
           * `likes` - Sort the results by number of likes. To use this option, **direction** must be `desc`.
           * `modified_time` - Sort the results by last modification.
           * `plays` - Sort the results by number of plays. To use this option, **direction** must be `desc`.
